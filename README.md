## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Requirements

## Installation

KFXAdditions is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "KFXAdditions"
```

## Overview

Various categories of Cocoa/Touch classes including classes from UIKit, Foundation and CoreLocation.


## Note

The code in these categories comes from various sources and have been collected over a number of years. Some is lifted straight from StackOverflow, some has been half-inched from other open source libraries and some I've written myself. I've tried to put credits when the code was written by someone else but I know I haven't always so if you recognised some code and care enough to want a credit & link then let me know and I'll be happy to oblige.
